/*
Peet Bros. (PRO) anemometer interface.

Read the wind speed and direction interrupts from two input pins, do some math,
and output this over Serial as NMEA0183.

The anemometer itself is designed so that the two inputs does not signal
at the same time. We can use simple non-interruptable interrupts and still
be pretty sure not to lose any events.

Connectors used:
* GND - the two ground wires towards the anemometer.
* pin 2 - rotating pin on anemometer.
* pin 3 - direction pin on anemometer.

Remaining:
* power saving, it uses ~40mA on an Uno now.
* calibration!
