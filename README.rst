Peet Bros. Anemometer interface
===============================

Peet Bros. sells anemometers/wind sensors that operate down to
0.67m/s and with a directional accuracy of 1.4 degrees.

This is standalone Arduino code for outputting NMEA0183 wind
data over serial over USB.

Output can for example be fed to an NMEA software multiplexer like
kplex.
